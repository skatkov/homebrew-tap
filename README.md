# homebrew-tap
Personal homebrew tap with software that I wrote for personal use. By accident, this is available to the world wide web.

## SepaTUI
A Terminal User Interface (TUI) application for viewing and analyzing SEPA XML payment files (something europeans use to send money all over EU)

### Install
`brew install skatkov/tap/sepa`

## Stoic
`stoic` is a command line app for daily journaling with plain-text files. It helps maintain a daily journaling habit; main usage is a practice philosophy by writing it down day by day.

### Install
```
brew install skatkov/tap/stoic
```

### Source code
https://github.com/skatkov/stoic

## POSH TUI
POSH TUI is a terminal based documentation browser for Ruby developers. The source code for the TUI application is not available, but the software itself is available under a freemium model (hint: meaning there will be premium features). Some other work related to this project is open source, though.

### Install
```
brew install skatkov/tap/poshtui
```
